# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses the classic **Titanic dataset** to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not.  
It is a popular beginner project that covers data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset typically includes details of passengers, such as:
- PassengerId
- Pclass (Ticket class)
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked (Port of embarkation)
- Survived (Target variable: 0 = No, 1 = Yes)

You can find the dataset on [Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## ✅ Objectives
- Explore and analyze the Titanic dataset.
- Perform data cleaning and handle missing values.
- Feature engineering: convert categorical data into numeric, extract useful information.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict survival.
- Gain insights into factors that affected passenger survival.

## ⚙️ Steps
1. **Data Exploration & Visualization**
   - Understand data distributions and relationships.
   - Identify missing data and outliers.
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values (e.g., fill missing Age, Embarked).
   - Encode categorical variables (Sex, Embarked, etc.).
   - Feature scaling if needed.
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extract titles from names.
   - Create family size features.
   - Bin continuous variables (e.g., Age groups, Fare groups).
4. **Model Building**
   - Train models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and KNN.
   - Compare model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
5. **Evaluation & Insights**
   - Interpret feature importance.
   - Test on hold-out set or use cross-validation.

## 📦 Libraries Used
- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn & matplotlib
- scikit-learn

---

## 📊 Results
The model predicts whether a passenger survived with an accuracy of about **XX%** (replace with your actual result).  
Feature importance shows factors like:
- Passenger class
- Sex
- Age
- Fare
played a significant role in survival.
